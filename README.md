## 🧠 What Does the Aimbot Do?

In *Dark and Darker*, combat is all about **precise aiming** with zero room for error. The aimbot takes over your aiming system and:

* 📌 Locks directly onto enemies’ heads or body
* 🎯 Tracks moving targets and predicts movement
* 🔕 Silent aim available — hit shots *without even aiming*
* ⚙️ Customizable FOV, sensitivity, and priority targets

It’s especially OP for **Ranger**, **Wizard**, and even **Clerics** using projectile-based attacks.
